# Module-1-Assessment-5

A build as you learn superhero app project with a funky twist :)

## This project has taught me how to:

- add icons to a navigation bar and display the icons next to the nav items
- add a link to nav item which takes a user to another page 
- add images to a web page and resize the image according to different screen sizes
- attach a link to an image that navigates to another page
- and how to have fun with the projects I'm building :D
